# Pathfinding Visualizer

A dynamic and interactive visualization tool for popular pathfinding algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS). Watch algorithms explore a grid, find the shortest path, and navigate around obstacles in real time.


## Features

- Visualizes Dijkstra, BFS, and DFS algorithms
- Interactive grid with wall (obstacle) placement
- Speed controls
- Real-time animation of pathfinding steps
